"--start of the project--

In this project i'm going to code a recipe website using the things i have learned so far. 

so far i have learned about the the structure of a basic html file and how to write paragraph, how to write headings, how to make bold text, how to italize a text, how to include a link to your webpage and how you can connect to other pages on your own website and other public websites. i also learned how to add image to my website and that i have to had alt text so people who cant see the image can understand the image or if the image didn't load the alt text will be displayed."
