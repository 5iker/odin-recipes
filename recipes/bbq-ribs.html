    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>BBQ ribs are a mouthwatering dish featuring pork or beef ribs cooked low and slow over a barbecue grill or in a smoker. They are typically seasoned with a flavorful dry rub or marinated in a tangy barbecue sauce, then cooked until tender and juicy. The slow cooking process allows the meat to become tender while infusing it with smoky flavors. BBQ ribs are often served with additional barbecue sauce on the side for dipping and are a popular choice at summer cookouts, restaurants, and backyard gatherings.</p>
