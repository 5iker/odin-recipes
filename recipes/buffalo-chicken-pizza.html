    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Buffalo-style chicken pizza is a savory dish that combines the flavors of Buffalo chicken wings with the classic elements of pizza. It typically features a base of tangy buffalo sauce instead of traditional marinara, topped with shredded or diced cooked chicken breast tossed in more buffalo sauce. This spicy chicken is then layered over a bed of melted mozzarella cheese and sometimes accompanied by additional toppings such as blue cheese crumbles, thinly sliced red onions, and drizzles of ranch or blue cheese dressing. The result is a zesty and satisfying pizza with a spicy kick that appeals to fans of both Buffalo wings and pizza.</p>
